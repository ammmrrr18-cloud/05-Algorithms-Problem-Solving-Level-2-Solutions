# 📘 05 - Algorithms & Problem Solving – Level 2 (Programming Advices)

🎉 I’m happy to share that I’ve completed the **05 – Algorithms & Problem Solving Level 2** course  [AbouHadhood Platform](https://programmingadvices.com/). 🏆  

This repository contains **algorithmic problems and solutions** from Level 2, focusing on deepening problem-solving skills while applying the **Divide & Conquer** approach.

---

## 🚀 Course Overview
This phase was all about:
- Diving deeper into algorithms and problem-solving strategies.
- Refining structured programming skills.
- Staying true to the principle: **Divide & Conquer**.

We broke every problem into small, focused functions & procedures—each with a single responsibility—ensuring **clean, readable, and reusable code**.

---

## 💡 Key Highlights
- 🔹 Implementing functions from scratch instead of relying on built-in **cmath** library functions:
  - `abs()`
  - `round()`
  - `floor()`
  - `ceil()`
  - `sqrt()`
- 🔹 Practicing decomposition and function design.
- 🔹 Strengthening debugging and optimization skills.
- 🔹 Wrapping up with **two hands-on projects** that applied everything learned.
